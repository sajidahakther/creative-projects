   <p>Ways in which I have been creative:<br>
   I have changed the colours of the notes, creating a dark, cool-toned, neutral colour palette. I have changed the shape of the note into a rectangle and have adjusted the size, by making it smaller. I have created a nice transition by making the notes fade out as they age. Lastly, if you click across the width of the main piano camera, you can adjust the threshold. The left being the brightest and the right being the darkest.</p>
